<p>Between 1997 and 1998, <a href="(https://web.archive.org/web/19991008075438/http://www.splatsearch.com/sbmembers.html)">Eric Stubbs</a> became the webmaster for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990503120043/http://www.splatsearch.com/">Splat Search</a>, a general purpose search engine during the era of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19961022174810/http://altavista.com/">Alta Vista</a> &amp; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970412082333/http://askjeeves.com:80/">Ask Jeeves</a>.</p>
<p>On the surface, Splat Search, the search engine, isn’t all that interesting. It’s not possible to confirm Eric Stubbs as the owner. I’ve talked briefly with the freelancer who worked on the MySQL database of 600,000 indexed sites &amp; CGI scripts. However, no additional stories have come from this. I’ve used this article to follow up.</p>
<p>I’m most curious about the sweepstakes Splat Search ran in 1999. How did they work? How did people engage with them? In 1999, I was a preteen.</p>

<p>It’s notable how little exists about Splat Search online.  It doesn’t even have a footnote in Wikipedia. Search for yourself. If I’m wrong, be responsible and show me.</p>
<p>You might stumble on this <a href="https://moz.com/blog/search-spies">Rand Fishkin article</a>.  It isn’t a good one, but <a href="https://moz.com/blog/search-spies#comment-609">this comment by seoplebian</a> suggests that Splat Search was already somewhat of a low-quality site.</p>
<p>What is slightly more interesting is the story of the domain name.</p>
<h2 id="splatsearch.com"><a href="http://splatsearch.com">splatsearch.com</a></h2>
<p>According to Earl Grey, the current owner, it lay abandoned and up for grabs. He picked it up from a domain broker. His grand vision was to bring back the search engine. At the end of the day, greed won and it became an early coupon affiliate site.  It’s the oldest example of expired domain purchasing with intent to capitalize it for personal gains that I know of.</p>
<p>I didn’t take the time to do a further investigation in who owned the domain.</p>
